<h1>The Heart</h1>


<a href="https://rroll.to/QdLunS">
  <div class="big" >

<p class=right>
The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the tissue, while carrying metabolic waste -such as carbon dioxide- to the lungs.
</p>

    <p>The heart is a hollow muscle, about the size of a fist, that pumps blood all throughout the human body. The heart delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells, while removing metabolic waste. It is one of the most important organs in the human body. A human heart can remain viable for transplantation for approximately 4 to 6 hours when preserved on ice.</p>


<p>
The pericardium is a double-walled, fluid-filled sac that surrounds the heart and the roots of the major blood vessels, such as the superior and inferior vena cava and aorta. It protects the heart from infection and pressure; it also lubricates and limits its motion. It is often omitted in medical diagrams to better visualize the heart’s structure. The pericardium appears as a thin layer of yellow-white fat, surrounding the outside of the heart.
</p>

<p class=right>
The venae cavae are two long veins that run through the centre of the human body. The superior vena cava goes up, whereas the inferior vena cava goes down.
</p>

<p>
The venae cavae are two large veins located slightly off-center towards the right side of the body that return deoxygenated blood from the body into the heart. The inferior vena cava carries the deoxygenated blood from the lower and abdomen, whereas the superior vena cava carries deoxygenated blood throughout the upper half of the body, where they both empty into the right atrium of the heart. The superior vena cava is around 7 cm (2.7 inches) long, and the inferior vena cava is 10.16 cm (4 inches) long. They are both 2-3 cm in diameter, though sometimes they will dilate if the person is ill.
</p>

<p>
The aorta is the main, and largest, artery in the human body. Its diameter ranges from 2.5 to 3 cm, while smaller arteries generally have diameters of less than 1 cm. The aorta’s length is 30 cm (1 foot) long. The aorta is responsible for transporting oxygenated blood out of the heart and to the rest of the body. It consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta.
</p>

<p class=right>
Having one less pulmonary vein doesn't always mean it's a medical issue. Most people with this variation can go their entire lives without problems, but in other cases, it can cause serious health issues, including low oxygen levels in the blood, heart failure, and difficulty breathing.
</p>

<p>
Pulmonary veins drain specifically into the left atrium, whereas the vena cava drain specifically into the right. The pulmonary veins’ purpose is to collect oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and carry it to the heart. Generally people have four main pulmonary veins, two from each lung, but having less than four is called anatomical variation, this condition is often classified under the broader category of anomalous pulmonary venous return. Anomalous pulmonary venous return is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect properly to the left atrium of the heart, leading to oxygen-rich blood returning to the right side instead.
</p>

<p>
The pulmonary artery is a blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The pulmonary artery splits into the right and left pulmonary arteries, where they lead into the lungs.
They’re the only arteries in the body that carry deoxygenated blood. The largest pulmonary artery is the main pulmonary artery or pulmonary trunk from the heart, and the smallest ones are the arterioles, which lead to the capillaries that surround the pulmonary alveoli.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the difference between the pulmonary veins, and the pulmonary arteries;
Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, while pulmonary veins transport oxygenated blood to the lungs, back to the heart. The pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein are two vital components of the cardiovascular system. Together, the pulmonary veins along with the pulmonary arteries make up the pulmonary circulation.
</p>

<p>
The heart consists of four chambers and four valves. Two chambers are located at the top, and two at the bottom, with valves ensuring blood flows in the correct direction.
The two upper chambers are called the atria, and two lower chambers are called the ventricles. 
</p>

<p>
The left atrium's primary purpose is to receive oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and then pump it into the left ventricle, which sends it out to the rest of the body. It acts as a holding chamber that helps regulate blood flow within the heart.

</p>

<p>
The mitral valve, also known as the bicuspid valve, is one of the four heart valves. It lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle of the heart. The mitral valve and the tricuspid valve are known as the atrioventricular valves because they lie between the atria and the ventricles. All the valves in the heart's structure are one directional, so that blood can’t flow back into them, and forcing the blood to make its way throughout the body.

The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta, and it controls blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. 
</p>

<h1>The Liver</h1>

<p>
The liver preforms over 500 essential functions, including; filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile for digestion, storing nutrients, and regulates blood sugar levels.
It also plays a crucial role in metabolizing fats and proteins, and producing important blood proteins. The liver is located on the right side of your upper body. Under your ribs, and just next to your stomach. The liver typically weighs between 1.3 to 2.2 kilograms (3 or 5 pounds), and is approximately 15 centimeters (6 inches) in width. Though, its size can vary based on age, sex, and body size.
</p>

<p class=right>
The liver is the largest internal organ in the body, and one of the few organs that can regenerate itself.
